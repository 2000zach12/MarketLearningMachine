Welcome to the MLM, the goal is to get rich, ideally off the backs of others work, but looks like we are going to do this the hard way.

The goal is to use obsidian in order to track the connections between classes, functions, methods and all other whodads.


[[Data that might be Useful]]
Starting with [[F_Regression]]


Basic Plan
Build a simple model for each ML type and decide on what we like best
Decided where we want to source our data from and how we want it structured
Try deep learning models (Neural Networks) and see how that goes

Medium term goals
Find a model that works and try to predict medium to long term (1-3 Months) into the future and use that  to price options.
Mess around with trying to predict volitility
Maybe try to price volitility for specific events
